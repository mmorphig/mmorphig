### Just a system, but really it's just Kuro that does the programming stuff :3
Info on said system I guess is on [PluralKit](https://dash.pluralkit.me/profile/s/mhxzj?tab=system).<br>
Otherwise, everything you could possibly need to know is on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/mmorphig).<br>
It's also on the linktree and right there on the left, but if you want to bother us, you can try to at `mmorphig@proton.me`.<br>
Something that's **not** on Linktree is a pubkey, which is on [Proton Drive](https://drive.proton.me/urls/0PXK26NQAC#3ionJVdfLG1h)

Mostly do C, C++ and Java stuff (also some python scripts), but webdev and C# are not un-familiar.<br>
We have been daily-driving Arch Linux for a few (over 4) years now, so bash scripting is also not un-familiar.
