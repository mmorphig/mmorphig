Just a system, but really it's just Kuro that does the programming stuff :3
Info on said system I guess is here: [https://dash.pluralkit.me/profile/s/mhxzj?tab=system](https://dash.pluralkit.me/profile/s/mhxzj?tab=system)


Mostly do C, C++ and Java stuff (also some python scripts), but webdev and C# are not un-familiar. 
We have been daily-driving Arch Linux for a few (over 4) years now, so bash scripting is also not un-familiar.
